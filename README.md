### MeToo Hateful Speech Detection Using NLP
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing tweets from the #MeToo movement and classifying whether the content is hateful or non-hateful using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. The goal is to detect and analyze potentially harmful or offensive language within tweets, providing insights into the nature of online discourse surrounding the #MeToo movement.

The project is implemented in a Python Jupyter Notebook (MeToo_Hateful_NLP.ipynb) and leverages various NLP techniques to preprocess text data, build machine learning models, and evaluate their effectiveness in classifying hate speech.

### Dataset
The dataset for this project consists of tweets containing the #MeToo hashtag. Each tweet has been labeled as either hateful or non-hateful based on its content. The dataset includes typical features such as:

### Tweet text
Metadata like timestamp, user info (optional)
Labels (hateful or non-hateful)
Data preprocessing involves text cleaning, tokenization, vectorization, and handling imbalanced datasets.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: The tweets are preprocessed to remove noise, including:

Lowercasing
Removing special characters, punctuation, and stopwords
Tokenizing the text
Lemmatization/Stemming
Feature Extraction: Various NLP techniques are applied for feature extraction:

Bag of Words (BoW)
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, or custom embeddings)
Modeling: Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated for classification, including:

Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest
Neural Networks (Optional)
Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. The notebook includes visualizations of model performance.

Handling Imbalanced Data: Techniques such as class weighting or oversampling (e.g., SMOTE) are used to address imbalanced classes (hateful vs. non-hateful).
